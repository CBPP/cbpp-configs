# cbpp-configs 
Various configuration files for use with CBPP.  Moved to it's own repo! 

So now, if you'd like to build from your git clone, (I'd recommend copying the folder out first) cd into cbpp-configs, run _dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc_ and you'll find yourself with a proper Debian package one folder up.
